            <h6>Oct 2021 - Dec 2022</h6>
            <p>My job as an ophthalmic assistant was to assist with medical procedures,
                perform tests, image patients and document symptoms provided by patients via
                follow up visits or triage phone calls.
                Having anunder standing of pathology,anatomy of the eye and medical
                terminology was a must. All technicians were expected to learn most of this on
                their own time. My time at RCM also certified me to do advanced imaging,
                phlebotomy and medical studies imaging.</p>
